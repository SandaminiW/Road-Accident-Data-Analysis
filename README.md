Road Accident Data Analysis Excel

## Project Objective:
The objective of this project is to analyze road accident data for the years 2021 and 2022. The dashboard presents a detailed overview of different types of casualties, including fatal, serious, and slight injuries. The data is categorized by vehicle type, road type, road surface, and other environmental factors such as lighting and location (urban or rural). The goal is to identify patterns and trends in road accidents to help decision-makers implement more effective road safety policies and reduce the number of accidents. By visualizing this data, stakeholders can better understand accident hotspots and factors contributing to road safety issues.

## KPIS Requirement

 Road Accident Dashboard for year 2021 and 2022.

 1. Primary KPI -: Total Casualties taken place after the accident.

2. Primary KPI's -: Total Casualties & percentage of total with respect to accident severity and maximum casualties by type of vehicle.

3. Secondary KPI's -: Total Casualties with respect to vehicle type

4. Monthly trend showing comparison of casualties for current Year and Previous Year

5. Maximum trend showing comparison of casualties for Current Year and Previous Year

6. Distribution of total Casualties by Road Surface

7. Relation between Casualties by Area/Location & by Day/Night

## Final Conclusion:
From the data provided in the dashboard, the majority of casualties are slight, representing 84.1% of all cases, while serious casualties account for 14.2%, and fatal casualties for 1.7%. Cars are the primary vehicle type involved in accidents, contributing 79.8% of total casualties. Most accidents occurred on dry roads, with a significant portion happening on wet surfaces. Single carriageways are identified as high-risk roads. Moreover, urban areas witness a higher number of accidents compared to rural areas, while most incidents happen during daylight hours. This analysis highlights the need for targeted interventions in urban areas and specific road types to improve safety measures.
